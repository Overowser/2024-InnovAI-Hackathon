# TawarAI - AI-Powered Emergency Healthcare Report Generation System
## Abstract
### Background and Problem Statement

In Morocco, emergency services play a critical role in the healthcare system, serving as the primary point of entry for many patients. However, there are significant inefficiencies within the system, particularly in terms of emergency response times and resource allocation. Vital emergency cases only make up around 10% of the total emergency room visits, with the remaining 50% being non-urgent consultations. Despite the high demand, the healthcare system suffers from a shortage of skilled personnel and limited resources, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

TawarAI aims to address these challenges by providing an AI-powered solution to automate the creation of medical reports based on vital signs, enabling more efficient use of emergency services and improving overall care.

### Impact and Proposed Solution

TawarAI uses groqcloud API to call for llama 3.1 70b to assist healthcare professionals by analyzing real-time data from emergency patients, such as vital signs, and generating medical reports automatically. This technology streamlines the diagnosis process, ensuring quicker and more accurate treatment for patients in critical condition. The solution also helps optimize resource allocation, reduce the workload on medical staff, and minimize errors in documentation, ultimately improving the efficiency of emergency healthcare services.

By reducing manual report generation, TawarAI frees up medical professionals to focus on patient care, ultimately saving lives, improving decision-making, and reducing the burden on emergency departments. The solution also aims to assist in early anomaly detection, allowing healthcare professionals to intervene before a patient's condition worsens.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables

* API: A fully functional REST API that takes vital sign data in CSV format, processes the information, and generates a medical report. The API will be designed to later integrate with IoT systems for real-time data collection.
* Web App: A user-friendly web application that allows users to upload CSV files with patient vital signs, view the AI-generated medical reports, and download the reports in PDF format.
* Report Generation: The AI system will analyze the uploaded data, process it, and generate detailed medical reports, offering diagnosis suggestions and recommendations.
* Proof of Concept: A working prototype that can be tested with Kaggle's patient vitals dataset, demonstrating the system's potential in a real-world scenario.
